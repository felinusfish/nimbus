**Nimbus** is a Bluesky web client, built as a reasonably lightweight web alternative to the bloated Bluesky React Native experience. Nimbus is a fork of [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk) built by Vite.

> [!WARNING]  
> **Here be dragons!** Nimbus is in a pre-alpha state. It is not production-ready. Any and all developers are encouraged to [contribute to the project](https://github.com/nimbus-town/nimbus/labels/good-first-issue)! **Note that all major discussion occurs within the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4Kx9WVw8dP).**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing to Nimbus

### Local Setup
Before you can contribute to Nimbus, here is a short step-by-step guide on how to setup Nimbus on a local machine.

First, clone the repository. Then, run the following commands in the root folder:
```ts
pnpm i --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run dev
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You'll need to enable `corepack` before installing. For a more detailed guide, see the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Testing
As Nimbus uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev), you can simply run the test suite by running:

```ts
pnpm test
```

## üì≤ Progressive Web App (PWA)
Currently, our focus is on the client becoming functional for browsers, without using PWAs. When the time comes, you can consult the [PWA documentation](https://docs.nimbus.town/pwa) to learn more about the PWA capabilities of Nimbus, how to install Nimbus PWA onto a desktop or mobile device, and hints regarding the progressive web app.
